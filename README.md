Starting a problem on page 38 of Eloquent JavaScript 3rd editon. They want to create the logic to create a chessboard and then one of any size after that.

Was pretty simple to create but it has no interaction at all with the user at all which can be a problem. Turned everything into functions as well though it was unneccesary for this problem.

Made the webpage look more presentable as a whole. It looks exactly like a
chess board. It just needs the pieces and than a button to play the game.
